# WebExension Event Recorder

WebExtension Event Recorder is a browser automation tool that plays scripted `scenariors` of browser interactions and records series of `events` that a web-extension would receive.

To start the recording, first install dependencies with `npm ci`.

Record events from Chrome with `npm run start.chrome`

Record events from Firefox with `npm run start.firefox`

## Options

`--only <SCENARIOR PREFIX>` allows to run scenariors that start with file names starting with given prefix
